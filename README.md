WHAT IS STARLOCATOR
StarLocator is a celestial positioning application mainly based on a maritime navigation technique that has been applied for centuries. In this app, a photo of night sky and the exact time when it was taken were used as source information to calculate the rough position where the position of the photo taker on the earth. It is quite like using the camera as a sextant to measure the elevation of celestial body in the picture just as sailors did since 17th century, and there is NOTHING to do with astrology, metaphysics.

HOW TO USE
1.	Click “选择文件”, import your image. The image should follow these requirements:
a)	It is a real image of night sky;
b)	As clear as possible. Smear, defocus, and distortions could severely impact the positioning result;
c)	At least 5 celestial bodies including stars and planets. The sun and the moon are not acceptable since both of them are haram (joking). * In the initial release you need to recognize the stars by yourself but don’t worry, we are working on the automatic star recognizing function. We will install it before the heat death of the universe.
d)	Multiple plumb lines or a clear horizon are necessary for zenith calculation. The more plumb lines or the longer horizon, the more precise the result will be.
e)	You know the exact time (year, date, hour, minute, and better with second) when the photo was taken. 
2.	Click the shining shuriken icon to start to pick stars. The picked stars are better distributed horizontally, or if you know what exactly I’m talking, don’t form too small an angle relative to the zenith.
3.	Click the long limb alien icon to draw lines along plumb lines on the image. More is better.
4.	The other two buttons? No, you are not interested.
5.	SMASH the “给我算！” button and you’ll see the result below.
